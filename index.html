        <p>You should hunt because you want to not because people are pressuring you to. Yes there are a bunch of memories made everytime you go out, but hunting is not for everyone.</p>

            When I think of hunting I think of the woods. When I think of the woods I think on the sunrise, the view from the treestand, and the momories I make.
