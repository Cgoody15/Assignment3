    <h1>About Us!</h1>
 This company was built by a couple friends and one of their teachers who were in love with hunting since the day they started. WIth the teacher who already has the experience with filming and hunting the students didn't have to think twice about it. THis company started three years ago. Since then we have began to start expanding out of New York State. We are not in it for the fun of the kill, we are in it for the memories. That's how this all began; souly with memories the friends started to make while hunting.
